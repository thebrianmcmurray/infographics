# Dice Rolls Analysis

This is an infographic I made for fun. I regularly seem to roll poorly in games such as Dungeons and Dragons, and decided to perform a quick statistical analysis on my rolls. For this analysis I rolled three different dice 500 times in each hand for a total of 3,000 rolls. The Python notebook that was used to create the data that was used to build the infographic is included in this folder. The infographic was created using Canva.com.
