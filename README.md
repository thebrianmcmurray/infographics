## Dice Rolls
This is an infographic I made for fun. I regularly seem to roll poorly in games such as Dungeons and Dragons, and decided to perform a quick statistical analysis on my rolls. For this analysis I rolled three different dice 500 times in each hand for a total of 3,000 rolls. The notebook I used to create the data used to build the infographic is located at https://github.com/thebrianmcmurray/infographics/tree/main/dicerolls.
